## About

Complexity and monads.

Those underrated words are hiding everywhere in the code that we write every day
sometimes without knowing it. The purpose of the presentation is to unravel the
mystery of monads and to sneak peek on how to use them. We are going to find out
where they come from and why they were invented.

Don't be scared: we are just going to scratch the surface and this session will
be quite concrete with many code examples. It is open to any developer or person
with a technical profile, hoping that you want to know more about the beautiful
world of monads.
