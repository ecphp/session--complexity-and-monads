    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item In this presentation, we are going to dive into software development
        and try to understand why reading and writing code can sometimes be
        complex.
        \item We are going to define what makes code difficult to understand and
        find where complexity comes from.
        \item We are also going to give you tips and tricks to reduce code complexity.

    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Given an anonymous user
        \item When I reach the page /something/<any-number>
        \item Then it finds the entity with id <any-number>
        \item And the entity has a title
        \item And the title starts with 'abc'
        \item Then it returns the entity title in uppercase

        \item Time complexity
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The amount of elementary operations
        \end{itemize}
        \item Space complexity
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The amount of memory a program is using.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Kolmogorov complexity
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Given an output, this is the length of a shortest computer
            program that produces the output.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Cyclomatic complexity
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The quantitative measure of the number of linearly
            independent paths through a program's source code.
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
When building an application with a framework, all the tools are already
there, only the business logic needs to be implemented. We often rely on already
existing tools, using them is usually what introduces most of complexity.
\\

\vspace{\baselineskip}
The design of these tools have a great impact on how the end user will use them
and therefore, on the overall complexity of the application.

\vspace{\baselineskip}
So today we are going to only focus on the \textbf{Cyclomatic complexity}.
